				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is Strive Planner?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Strive Planner is an iOS app designed to help people live intentionally by aligning their daily actions with their values and goals. 
					It's particularly popular among returned missionaries who miss the structured planning they experienced during their mission service, 
					but it's perfect for anyone seeking more purpose in their daily life.

			<div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How is Strive Planner different from other productivity apps?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Unlike traditional productivity apps that focus on task completion and efficiency, Strive Planner emphasizes <strong>intentionality over productivity</strong>. 
					We help you focus on meaning and purpose rather than just output. The app combines daily intentions, goal tracking, calendar integration, 
					and reflection practices to create a holistic approach to intentional living.

			<div class="bg-gray-50 rounded-lg p-6">
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Is Strive Planner only for returned missionaries?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Not at all! While Strive Planner was inspired by the structured planning experience of missionaries, it's designed for anyone seeking to live more intentionally. 
					Our users include young professionals, families, students, and personal development enthusiasts who all share the desire to align their daily actions with their values.

				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Strive Planner is inspired by the structured planning approach used in missionary service, but adapted for post-mission life. While PMG/Areabook focuses on missionary work planning, 
					Strive Planner helps you plan your personal life, career, relationships, and spiritual growth. It maintains the same level of intentionality but applies it to all areas of life.
