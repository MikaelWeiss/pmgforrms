				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">What is Strive Planner?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Strive Planner is an iOS app designed to help people live intentionally by aligning their daily actions with their values and goals. 
					It's particularly popular among returned missionaries who miss the structured planning they experienced during their mission service, 
					but it's perfect for anyone seeking more purpose in their daily life.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">How is Strive Planner different from other productivity apps?</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Unlike traditional productivity apps that focus on task completion and efficiency, Strive Planner emphasizes <strong>intentionality over productivity</strong>. 
					We help you focus on meaning and purpose rather than just output. The app combines daily intentions, goal tracking, calendar integration, 
					and reflection practices to create a holistic approach to intentional living.
