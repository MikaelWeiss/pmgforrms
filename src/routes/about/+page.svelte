			<p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
				At Strive Planner, we believe that technology should serve humanity, not the other way around. 
				In a world of endless productivity apps and notification overload, we're creating something different: 
				a tool that helps you live with purpose rather than just produce more.
			</p>
			<p class="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
				Our mission is simple yet profound: help people bridge the gap between their values and their daily actions. 
				We're not just building another task manager—we're creating a companion for intentional living.

				<div class="space-y-4 text-gray-600">
					<p>
						<strong>Mikael Weiss</strong>, founder of Weiss Solutions LLC, created Strive Planner from a place of deep understanding and personal experience. 
						As an expert iOS developer with firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by returned missionaries, 
						Mikael recognized a critical gap in the market.
					</p>
					<p>
						"Having witnessed the structured, purposeful planning that happens during missionary service, 
						I saw how many individuals struggle to maintain that same intentionality when they return home," 
						Mikael explains. "They go from having clear goals and daily accountability to navigating life without that same framework."
					</p>
					<p>
						This insight sparked the creation of Strive Planner—an app that would bring the same sense of purpose and structure to post-mission life, 
						while remaining flexible enough to serve anyone seeking to live more intentionally.

						<p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
							Missionary service provides a unique environment of structured planning, clear purpose, and daily accountability. 
							Missionaries use tools like PMG (Preach My Gospel) to plan their days, set goals, and track progress.
						</p>
						<p class="text-gray-600">
							This creates powerful habits of intentionality that many missionaries struggle to maintain when they return to post-mission life.
